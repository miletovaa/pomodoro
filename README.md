# So... What is Pomodoro :)

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method for students, perfectionists, and procrastinators of all kinds. Work in focused, 25-minute intervals, and then a short interval of full relax.

That's what they say. For some reason I wanted to do this app by myself even before trying to find any convenient timer on the Internet. So, here it is.

For some reason I used PyQt6 and QML. 
And of course I haven't done anything using them before. 
The true queen of the rationalization. I know.

But I promise to use Electron for such  ✨ideas✨ in the future!!

_But what's about an app?_

## App
I wanted it to be simple and clear. It has minimum settings. For now there is an ability to change time of work and rest and set the output below the progress bar.

The progress bar sticks to the very top of the screen and overlays all of the windows:

When the time is over you get the notification about that:

The colors of the bar and the message of the notification changes depending on mode of time (was it work or rest).

In the future I want to compile it to .exe, add more customisation and functions to the app, so feel free to suggest something or report bugs.
